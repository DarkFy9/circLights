A music reactive visualizer program, that controls an WLED strip in loop shape over wifi:


live audio input similar to ledfx

A live website interface

I would like be able to set certain zones by position/pecentage of length (i.e. 25%-50%)
- each zone can independently be set to react differently (with a custom input range i.e. lows, highs, mids, (default all))
Types of reactions:
- normal visualizer
- flash to spike in vol (can customize threshold, or be auto)
- change color to spike in vol
- constant moving pattern that gets faster based on volume/spike

Feel free to suggest changes to this approach if apropriate
